First off, you may need to install some packages by typing:
1)yarn add react-router-dom
2)yarn add prop-types

Then you may type "yarn install" to install the project's dependencies

Then you can start the app by typing: yarn start

In the app, you have 3 categories/shelves of books: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
You can customize which book to place on which shelf and search for new books and add them to your collection.

In my project, I have implemented some of the ideas explained in the live sessions in my own way.
